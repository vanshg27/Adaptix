  tips: [
    "Always warm up with 5-10 minutes of light cardio before starting your workout",
    "Focus on progressive overload - gradually increase weight, reps, or sets each week",
    "Ensure adequate protein intake (0.8-1g per lb of body weight) to support muscle growth",
    "Get 7-9 hours of quality sleep for optimal recovery and muscle development",
    "Stay hydrated throughout your workouts and consume water regularly",
    "Take 1-2 rest days between workout sessions to allow for proper recovery",
    "If you feel pain (not muscle fatigue), stop the exercise and consult a professional"
